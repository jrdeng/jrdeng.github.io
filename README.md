# A blog that uses GitHub Issues as its database

A hexo site that uses Github Issues as input, and generated by using Github Actions when issues change or `hexo` folder changes.

`github issues` --> `issues.json` --> `hexo` --> `Github Pages`

Live: [https://wuming.me](https://wuming.me)

## Key steps

- Github Actions [.github/workflows/main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml) will be triggered when issues change or `hexo` folder changes. It will install dependencies and run following scripts.
- `1_query_issues.py` - Query issues in specific repo by using GraphQL and save issues in `issues.json`.
- `2_issues_to_posts.py` - Parse `issues.json` and generate hexo posts into `hexo/source/_posts/`.
- `3_gen_and_publish.sh` - Run hexo to generate static site and copy the contents to `docs` then push to github.
- Github Pages then will be deployed.

NOTE: issues.json and _posts/* are in the .gitignore by default.

## Customization

1. Copy/Clone this repo. Set `docs` folder as Github Pages source.
2. Modify `hexo/_config.yml` to configure your site info.
3. Modify `hexo/themes/maupassant/_config.yml` to configure your theme (nav bar, sider bar etc.), or use your favorite theme instead.
4. The `hexo/source/about/index.md` is the about page. You can modify it accordinly.
5. By default, the Github Action query issues from current repo. You can modify `.github/workflows/main.yml` to query issues from other repos.
