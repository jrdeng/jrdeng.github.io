# A blog that uses GitHub Issues as its database

A hugo site that uses Github Issues as input, and generated by using Github Actions when issues change or hugo-template changes.

`github issues` --> `issues.json` --> `hugo` --> `Github Pages`

## Key steps

- Github Actions [.github/workflows/main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml) will be triggered when issues change or hugo-template changes. It will install dependencies and run following scripts.
- `1_query_issues.py` - Query issues in specific repo by using GraphQL and save issues in `issues.json`.
- `2_issues_to_posts.py` - Parse `issues.json` and generate hugo posts by using `template` as a template.
- `3_gen_and_publish.sh` - Run hugo to generate static site and copy the contents to `docs` then push to github.
- Github Pages then will be deployed.
